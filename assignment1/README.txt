Answers to Questions:
1)
2) In both executions, sys time is longer because the Operating System is the one downloading the files and storing them into the hard drive. User mode does have the privilege to write to the hard drive.
3) Parallel finishes faster because there are multiples cores for processing. Serial downloads two files with the same process, but parallel can download 2 files with two different processes
